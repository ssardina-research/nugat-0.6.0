0.6.0 (October 2015): ported NuGAT to NuGAT 2.6.0 (see MIGRATION-0.6.0)
0.5.4 (June 2015): ported NuGAT to NuGAT 2.5.4 (see MIGRATION-0.5.4)
0.5.0: from from http://es.fbk.eu/technologies/nugat-game-solver
       (only works with NuSMV 2.5.0; does not compile with newer versions)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

NuGaT is a game solver built on top of the NuSMV model checker.

This is the release based on the original 0.5.0 version so as to make
it compatible with the latest NuSMV 2.5.4 which introduced many changes.

We make no guarantees about commands, features, or interfaces being the 
same or even available in potential future versions.

3. BUILDING NUGAT
=================

NuGaT uses NuSMV 2.5 as its backend. Hence, in order to build and use
NuGaT you should first obtain and build NuSMV 2.5. For this we refer
to the NuSMV 2.5 documentation.

We refer to INSTALL for detail instructions for 0.5.4. What follows are
the original instructions for 0.5.0:

Below we assume that your have successfully compiled NuSMV 2.5. We
further denote the full path of the "nusmv" directory of that
installation by $(nusmv_dir).

Basic building steps:

1. Download NuGaT into a convenient directory, e.g., /tmp.

2. Move to the directory where you would like to build NuGaT and
   unpack the distributions:

	% cd /home/nusmv		    # for example
	% tar -xvjf /tmp/NuGaT-0.5.0.tar.bz2

   The configure script of NuGaT tries to locate NuSMV 2.5 and NuGaT
   in the same subdirectory. For this reason we use "nusmv" as the
   name of this subdirectory because this follows the example in the
   NuSMV README.

3. Move into the NuGaT directory and run configure, which will
   determine some system-specific parameters and create the
   Makefile. Use the --with-nusmv-dir option to indicate the location
   of NuSMV 2.5.

	% cd NuGaT-0.5.0                    # let this be $(nugat_dir)
	% ./configure --with-nusmv-dir=$(nusmv_dir)
   
   Note: Not all checks will return "yes". This is normal and should
   not affect compilation. However, do be concerned with any warnings
   "configure" produces.

   Note: Occasionally, configure will make a bad guess or will choose
   a default you do not want. In this case, simply edit the Makefile
   at this point.

Actually I am running this now with NuSMV 2.6:

./configure --with-nusmv-dir=/home/ssardina/src/NuSMV/source/NuSMV-2.6.0/NuSMV --with-cudd-dir=/home/ssardina/src/NuSMV/source/NuSMV-2.6.0/cudd-2.4.1.1

3. Run setup.sh in /home/ssardina/src/NuSMV/source/NuSMV-2.6.0/cudd-2.4.1.1

Need to install libMiniSAT library into the system:

Go here:

/home/ssardina/src/NuSMV/source/NuSMV-2.6.0/NuSMV/build/build-MiniSat


and run sudo make install

4. Build NuGaT by running GNU's make utility:

	% make

   This builds an executable "NuGaT" in the current directory.

5. Checking LTLGAME properties currently requires a slightly modified
   version of the LTL to B\"uchi translator available in Lily.

   1. Download lily-2008-06-19.tar.gz from the following URL:
      http://www.iaik.tugraz.at/content/research/design_verification/lily/lily-2008-06-19.tar.gz
      into a convenient directory, e.g., /tmp.

   2. Move to the directory where you would like Lily to reside, e.g.,
      /usr/local/src and unpack Lily:

        % cd /usr/local/src
        % tar -xvzf /tmp/lily-2008-06-19.tar.gz

   3. Move into the Lily directory and apply the patch provided in
      NuGaT-0.5.0/contrib:

        % cd Lily-1.0.2
        % patch -p1 < NuGaT-0.5.0/contrib/Lily-1.0.2.patch

   4. Make lily.pl known to NuGaT by either creating a symbolic link
      in a directory in the search path:

        % ln -s /usr/local/src/Lily-1.0.2/lily.pl /usr/local/bin/lily.pl

      or by setting the NuSMV shell variable
      game_sf07_gba_wring_binary to the full path of lily.pl (see the
      NuSMV documentation for details).


========
4. Usage
========

This section contains some hints on how to use NuGaT.

It is assumed that the reader is familiar with concepts of two player
games.

Games are implemented as a special mode of NuGaT which is entered when
a source file containing a game is given either as input file when
calling NuGaT or when using the "read_model" or the "read_rat_file"
commands in the NuGaT shell. The mode is left when the "reset" command
is used in the NuGaT shell. While in game mode the NuGaT shell command
help provides an overview of the available commands. Calling a NuGaT
shell command with argument "-h" prints a brief usage message.

For an example on how to write games in NuGaT see
examples/simple.smv. It can be invoked either in batch mode:

        % ./NuGaT examples/simple.smv

or interactively:

        % ./NuGaT -int
        [...banner...]
        NuGaT > read_model -i examples/simple.smv
        Entering game mode...
        Done entering game mode.
        Note that now game commands apply.
        NuGaT > go
        *** WARNING: Game addon does not support properties COI size sorting.  ***
        *** WARNING: Properties COI size sorting will be disabled.             ***

        --   ReachTarget PLAYER_1 o0.v  : the strategy has been found

        --   AvoidTarget PLAYER_2 o0.v  : no strategy exists

        --   ReachDeadlock PLAYER_1   : no strategy exists

        --   AvoidDeadlock PLAYER_2   : the strategy has been found

        --   BuchiGame PLAYER_2 (i1, o1)  : the strategy has been found

        --   LtlGame PLAYER_1  F ( G i1)  : no strategy exists

        --   GenReactivity PLAYER_2 (i0.v) -> (o0.v, i1)  : the strategy has been found

        NuGaT > quit
        Exiting game mode...
        Done exiting game mode.
        Note that now the commands from before entering game mode apply.

===============
5. Restrictions
===============

Currently, not all features of the NuSMV language (see the NuSMV 2.5
documentation) are supported in games. Notable examples of unsupported
constructs are assignments (ASSIGN), invariants (INVAR), and
processes.


===============
6. Known issues
===============

There is an unresolved issued in the BDD encoder of NuSMV 2.5. If you
see assertion violations of the following kind

NuGaT: bdd/BddEnc.c:4025: bdd_enc_shuffle_variables_order: Assertion `res == 1' failed.
Aborted

then please apply the patch provided in NuGaT-0.5.0/contrib to
$(nusmv_dir)/nusmv/src/enc/bdd/BddEnc.c and recompile first NuSMV and
then NuGaT:

        % cd $(nusmv_dir)/code/nusmv/core/enc/bdd/
        % patch BddEnc.c < $(nugat_dir)/contrib/BddEnc.c.patch
        % cd ../../..
        % make
        % cd $(nugat_dir)
        % make
